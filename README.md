# SiD_ECalAnalysis
the 
The stand-alone scripts contained in this directory are used to make all the figures displayed in the SiD ECal notes found at http://pages.uoregon.edu/asteinhe/SiDNotes/ . The four notes have associated directories with figures, and identically named directories under this repository containing the scripts used to create them. Some scripts are capable of creating more figures that were not included in the notes themselves.
